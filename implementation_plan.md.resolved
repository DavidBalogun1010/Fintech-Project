# Expand Advanced EDA for Deeper Fintech Insights

## Goal Description
The user wants to enhance the [advanced_eda.py](file:///c:/Users/DELL/Documents/Fintech_Project/advanced_eda.py) script to provide more sophisticated insights while retaining the current analysis. I will implement **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis**, **Churn Risk Identification**, and **Transaction Type Trends**. These are standard, high-impact metrics in fintech for understanding customer value and retention.

## Proposed Changes

### Analysis Script

#### [MODIFY] [advanced_eda.py](file:///c:/Users/DELL/Documents/Fintech_Project/advanced_eda.py)
- **Retain**: Keep existing Country Volume, Avg Spend, and Monthly Trend visualizations.
- **[NEW] RFM Segmentation**:
    -   Calculate Recency (days since last transaction), Frequency (count), and Monetary (sum) for each customer.
    -   Score customers (1-5) on each metric.
    -   Create a "Customer Segment" column (e.g., "Loyal", "At Risk", "New").
    -   **Viz**: Scatter plot of Recency vs. Monetary, colored by Segment.
-   **[NEW] Churn Risk Analysis**:
    -   Identify customers inactive for > 90 days.
    -   Calculate overall Churn Rate.
    -   **Viz**: Pie chart or Bar chart of Active vs. Churned customers.
-   **[NEW] Transaction Type Trends**:
    -   Analyze how transaction types (POS, Bill Payment, Transfer) evolve over time.
    -   **Viz**: Stacked Area Chart of Transaction Count by Type over Month.

## Verification Plan
### Automated Verification
- Run the detailed python script: `python advanced_eda.py`
- Check for successful connection to Snowflake.
- Verify that new PNG files are generated:
    -   `eda_rfm_segments.png`
    -   `eda_churn_risk.png`
    -   `eda_type_trends.png`
